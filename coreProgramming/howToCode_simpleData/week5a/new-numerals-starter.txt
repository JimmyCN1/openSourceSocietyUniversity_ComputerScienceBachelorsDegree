; 
; PROBLEM:
; 
; Your friend has just given you a new pad, and it runs a prototype version of Racket. 
; 
; This is great, you can make it do anything. There's just one problem, this version of 
; racket doesn't include numbers as primitive data. There just are no numbers in it!
; 
; But you need natural numbers to write your next program.
; 
; No problem you say, because you remember the well-formed self-referential data definition 
; for Natural, as well as the idea that add1 is kind of like cons, and sub1 is kind of like
; rest. Your idea is to make add1 actually be cons, and sub1 actually be rest...
; 
; 


;; NATURAL is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons "!" NATURAL)
;; interp. a natural number, the number of "!" in the list is the number
(define N0 empty)          ;0
(define N1 (cons "!" N0))  ;1
(define N2 (cons "!" N1))  ;2
(define N3 (cons "!" N2))  ;...
(define N4 (cons "!" N3))
(define N5 (cons "!" N4))
(define N6 (cons "!" N5))
(define N7 (cons "!" N6))
(define N8 (cons "!" N7))
(define N9 (cons "!" N8))

;; These are the primatives that operate on the new kind of NATURAL:
(define (ZERO? n) (empty?   n))    ;Any         -> Boolean
(define (ADD1  n) (cons "!" n))    ;NATURAL     -> NATURAL
(define (SUB1  n) (rest     n))    ;NATURAL[>0] -> NATURAL

(define (fn-for-NATURAL n)
  (cond [(ZERO? n) (...)]
        [else
         (... n
              fn-for-NATURAL (SUB1 n))]))

;; NATURAL NATURAL -> NATURAL
;; produce a + b
(check-expect (ADD N2 N0) N2)
(check-expect (ADD N0 N3) N3)
(check-expect (ADD N3 N4) N7)

;(define (ADD a b) N0)     ;stub

(define (ADD a b)
  (cond [(ZERO? b) a]
        [else
         (ADD (ADD1 a) (SUB1 b))]))


;; NATURAL NATURAL -> NATURAL
;; produce a - b
(check-expect (SUB N2 N0) N2)
(check-expect (SUB N4 N1) N3)
(check-expect (SUB N0 N0) N0)

;(define (SUB a b) N0)    ;stub

(define (SUB a b)
  (cond [(ZERO? b) a]
        [else
         (SUB (SUB1 a) (SUB1 b))]))
